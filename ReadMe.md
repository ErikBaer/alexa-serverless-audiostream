# Simple Alexa Skill â€“ Radio Streaming by BaerData

## Description:

Just invoke the Skill and enjoy listening to the stream of your favourite radio-station.

An example for a simple Alexa-skill configured and implemented via the serverless framework, written in node.js and typescript. 
 This solution is partly based on a reference implementation by the Alexa Developer Team, as presented and discussed 
 in the multi-part video-series "Zero to Hero: A comprehensive course to building an Alexa Skill". Please kindly find the source code as well as further information on the reference series and beyond by following the links below:

In order to enable full development, configuration as well as deployment of the  Alexa-Skill alongside the necessary backend resources directly via the Serverless Framework,
this solution additionally leverages capabilities of the official SDK, realized via the plugin "serverless-alexa-skills":
